## Project Structure

This [workspace](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/workspaces/) is
composed the following projects:

- **`client`:** The frontend of our application. This project houses the Trakt
  Web client, built with Deno and SvelteKit. It's designed to be efficient and
  user-friendly, providing quick access to media insights.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required for the workspace to function
properly:

### Development

- **`TRAKT_CLIENT_ID`:** The client ID for the Trakt API.
- **`TRAKT_CLIENT_SECRET`:** The client secret for the Trakt API.

### External Contribution - Get Involved!

Want to contribute to Trakt Web? Great! Here's how to get set up:

1. **Create a Trakt Application:** Go to
   [Trakt Settings](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications) and create a new
   application.
1. **Set the `Redirect uri:`:** Set this to `http://localhost:5173/` for local
   development.
1. **Set the `Javascript (cors) origins:`:** Also set this to
   `http://localhost:5173/` to allow cross-origin requests.
1. Use the Client ID and Client Secret in your development environment.

**Important Note:**

Public applications might have some limitations, including:

- **"Up Next" Functionality:** This feature showing your future viewing queue
  may not work properly.

These limitations are in place to protect Trakt Web from scrapers and bots.

Now go ahead and contribute your best work to Trakt Web! âœ¨

## Getting Started

This is a Deno project, so you need to have Deno installed on your machine
please refer to the
[Deno installation guide](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/).

1. **Clone the repository**
1. **Install dependencies:** `deno task install`
1. **Run tasks:**

- Workspace:
  - Format & Lint: `deno task format`

- Client:
  - Development: `deno task client:dev`
  - Contributors: `deno task client:dev:contrib`

## Client Environment - Development Setup

### Web Development

For web development, run `deno task dev` or `deno task dev:contrib` (for
external contributors) in the `projects/client` directory. Then open your
browser to see your work.

### Android Development

For Android development, you can:

- **Install Development PWA:** Install a development version of the Progressive
  Web App on your Android device with remote debugging capabilities.
- **Debug Website Version:** Use Chrome browser for debugging the website
  version.

To set this up, refer to the Chrome Remote Debugging
[documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging/).
Connect your development environment to Android through the device management
portal at `chrome://inspect/#devices`. This works with:

- **Option 1: Android Studio Emulated Device**
- **Option 2: Physical Device (USB Connection)**

After connecting, set up a reverse proxy with:

```bash
adb reverse tcp:5173 tcp:5173
```

### iOS Development

**Coming Soon!**

## Build Trakt Web

To build the Trakt Web client, run:

```sh
cd projects/client/
[deno|npm|bun] run build
```

## Production Preview

### Vite

Run the following command:

```sh
[deno|npm|bun] run build:preview && [deno|npm|bun] run preview
```

## Update Minor Dependencies

### Install `npm-check-updates`

```bash
deno install -g --allow-all -n ncu npm:npm-check-updates
```

NOTE: For the client project add the `-p npm` since we're using a `package.json`
definition for the svelte project.

### Production

- **Check:** `ncu --dep prod -t minor`
- **Update:** `ncu --dep prod -t minor -u`

### Development

- **Check:** `ncu --dep dev -t minor`
- **Update:** `ncu --dep dev -t minor -u`

Verify that the above steps run smoothly and revert any changes that break the
build (this should generally not be the case).

## Update Major Dependencies

- **Production:** `ncu --dep prod -t latest`
- **Development:** `ncu --dep dev -t latest`

For each entry listed as a result:

1. `ncu <ENTRY> -u -t latest`
1. Build
1. Update any breaks
1. Test
1. Commit

## Resolving i18n Conflicts

### Handling Translation Conflicts

If rebasing causes conflicts in your `client/i18n/messages` folder, here's how
to fix them:

When merging your changes with the `main` branch, conflicts may occur in
translation files. This is normal when multiple people are working on
internationalization.

To resolve these conflicts:

1. **Make sure you have the `deno` CLI installed**
2. **Run the resolution command** from the project root:

   ```bash
   deno task client:i18n:resolve
   ```

   Or if you're in the `projects/client` directory:

   ```bash
   deno task i18n:resolve
   ```

These commands will resolve conflicts in the `i18n/messages/*.json` files and
merge the translations properly.

[INFRASTRUCTURE.md](INFRASTRUCTURE.md).
